=== Definition ===

A security vulnerability is (for example) when a user of Kamailio can cause Kamailio to crash or lock up by sending messages to the server process.

=== Reporting a security Vulnerability ===

If you believe there's a security vulnerability, please don't use the public forums. Send an e-mail to security@kamailio.org and the issue will be handled properly. 

  - Send an e-mail to security at kamailio dot org and include the following information
     * A summary
     * A detailed explanation of how this issue can be exploited and/or reproduced
  - A member of the Kamailio Security Team will respond
  - The kamailio developer team will work to solve the issue. When there is a patch for the issue, it should NOT be committed directly without clarification with the security team. It should be coordinated with the release of a security release as well as the publication of a Kamailio project security vulnerability report.

=== Publishing security vulnerabilities ===

Kamailio will publish security vulnerabilities, including an CVE ID, on the kamailio-announce mailing list, sr-users as well as related lists. The advisories will also be published on the kamailio.org web site.

=== Kamailio Security Team ===

A Kamailio Security team is appointed with core developers of the project. These individuals will be part of the security process and review patches and text for the vulnerability report. Persons of this group take the role of Kamailio Security Officers. One of these should manage each security incident - which does not mean solving the code issue, but managing the process from report to publication and patch release.

=== security@kamailio.org ===

This address should have a PGP key associated, used by the security officers.
