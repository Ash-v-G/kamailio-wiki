    * dbg_pv_dump() dumps the pv_cache content in json format.
  * new RPC commands:
    * options to enable/disable per module log level as well as set per module log level at runtime.
    * dbg.reset_msg: resets the msgid ( $mi ).
==== htable ====

  * new htable.sets and htable.seti RPC commands
  * cross-server replication via DMQ module integration

==== nathelper ====

  * new option - natping_disable_bflag can be set on a per-registration basis to disable NAT pings completely

==== outbound ====

  * flow-token key is now automatically generated
==== permissions ====

* DNS domain names in address table - possibility to check also against DNS domain names with allow_address() function.Now in the address table one group can have exact IPs, subnet IPs and DNS domain names

==== presence ====

  * RPC command presence.cleanup

==== pv ====

  * RPC commands shvGet and shvSet to manipulate and list shared variables
==== registrar ====

  * add Supported headers for outbound extensions in replies
  * RFC 5626 section 6 support - behaviour when outbound in use but first edge proxy does not support it

  * set_q_override API function - override the value of the q parameter from the Contact header in subsequent calls to the save() function for the current request

==== rr ====

  * use sips to build RR headers if R-URI has sips
==== sca ====

  * private hold handling



==== sdpops ====

  * new functions:
    * sdp_with_transport(string). Checks if is a media with the transport string.
    * sdp_remove_transport(string). Removes the media info from the SDP that matches string transport.

==== snmpstats ====

  * the SNMPstats module has been extended with a large set of new data, and the KAMAILIO-MIB has been extended with new OIDs

===== New in Core =====

  * IPv6 compile time flag removed - it is not possible to compile Kamailio without IPv6 anymore, improving the code maintainability in the core and several modules
  * the syn_branch parameter has been removed from the core, as Kamailio was not fully standard compliant if this was activated.

==== Components ====

  * SCTP support implementation from core was moved as a module. No need to recompile everything to get SCTP support, just load sctp module
