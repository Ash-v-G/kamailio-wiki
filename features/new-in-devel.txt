===== New Modules =====


===== New in Old Modules =====

== SNMPstats ==
The SNMPstats module has been extended with a large set of new data, and the KAMAILIO-MIB has been extended with new OIDs. The new data reflects the Kamailio server process (memory, configuration at compile time), network transports and modules.

== CFGutils ==
The CFGutils module has a few new functions. Route_if_exists() calls a routing block only if it exists in the configuration script. check_route_exists() checks if a routing block exists in the script.

== siputils ==
New function is_supported(option) that can be used to check if request has a Supported header listing the given option.

== usrloc ==
Added more RPC commands:
  * ul.rm
  * ul.rm_contact
  * ul.flush
  * ul.add

ul.add RPC and ul_add MI commands modified to be able to set the contact path
===== New in Core =====

Its not possible to compile Kamailio without IPv6 anymore, improving the code maintainability in the core and several modules.

==== Components ====


===== Tools =====

== kamctl ==
Now it's possible to add the contact path: ''kamctl ul add <user> <uri> <expires> <path>''
