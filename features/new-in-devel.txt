  * add domain aliases with --alias
  * set advertised address to listen sockets speficied with -l socket/advertise
  * set server id with --server-id
  * set a subst, substdef or substdefs preprocessor expression with --subst, --substdef or --substdefs

More information: https://www.kamailio.org/w/2019/05/kamailio-command-line-arguments/

==== Interpreter ====

Many extensions to the KEMI scripting language support in core and modules were added.

==== Parameters ====

  * New global parameter bind_ipv6_link_local. If set to 1, try to bind also IPv6 link local addresses by discovering the scope of the interface. This apply for UDP socket for now, to be added for the other protocols.
    * https://www.kamailio.org/wiki/cookbooks/devel/core#bind_ipv6_link_local
  * Introduce new configuration parameter tcp_accept_haproxy parameter. When active, inbound TCP connections are expected to behave according to the HA PROXY protocol. Both the v1 (human-readable) and v2 (binary) versions of the protocol are supported.
    * https://www.kamailio.org/wiki/cookbooks/devel/core#tcp_accept_haproxy
  * Added latency_limit_cfg global parameter to print execution time for configuration script only if it exceeds this value. It is printed to latency_cfg_log level, another added parameter.
    * https://www.kamailio.org/wiki/cookbooks/devel/core#latency_limit_action
    * https://www.kamailio.org/wiki/cookbooks/devel/core#latency_cfg_log

==== Functions ====

  * New rpc command core.psa - to print attributes stored in process table, similar to core.psx, but also prints the rank and status fields 

==== Memory Managers ====

Refactoring and unification of memory allocation error logging infrastructure. Completed in the core, major modules were migrated as well.

==== Architecture ====

  * Extend internal IPv4 and IPv6 parsing functions in the core.
  * Create Contacts header with path vector as Route header. When Kamailio is functioning as a registrar sends a 302 redirect, the registered contacts are sent inside the Contact header. If a contact as a path vector, that path should become a Route header in the INVITE (rfc 3327). This patch adds the path vector as a Route header parameter to the Contacts in the redirect so the receiving entity of the 302 can add the proper Route headers. This is a standard way to specify headers to be added to a request, see rfc3261 section 19.1.1.

==== kamailio.cfg ====

===== Tools =====

Added tool to generate code for KEMI modules to misc/tools/kemi/kemi-code-gen.py - can generate typedefs for functions and the large if-else blocks for variants of parameters.

==== kamcmd ====

==== kamctl ====

  * Added subcommand to print the server version using rpc command: kamctl srv version 
  * Added subcommand to delete older expired records from database table: kamctl ul dbclean [<secs>]
  * Added acc initdb command to add additional columns needed with default kamailio.cfg and defined WITH_ACCDB for acc and missed_calls table.

==== kamdbctl ====

  * Added verification before database reinit
  * Warn that drop command will indeed drop the database.
    
==== kamcli ====
