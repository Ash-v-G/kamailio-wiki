===== New in Core =====

==== Interpreter ====

==== Parameters ====

  * mem_safety - now enabled by default
  * verbose_startup - control if printing routing tree and udp probing buffer debug messages should be printed at startup

==== Functions ====

==== Misc ====

  * support for parsing the Call-Info header
  * do not terminate on harmless SIGCHLD (e.g., when kemi python scripts create and terminate new processes)
  * added function to return route block name from crt action
  * compile with system malloc for pkg if MEMPKG=sys
  * if MEMDBGSYS=1, the use a debug variant for system malloc
  * support for base58 encoding and decoding
  * mem - new functions for pkg/shm - mallocxz() and reallocxf()
    * pkg_mallocxz(size) / shm_mallocxz(size) - same as the corresponding malloc function, but the allocated buffer is filled with 0. It is equivalent of { p=malloc(size); if(p) memset(p, 0, size); }
    * pkg_reallocxf(p, size)/shm_reallocxf(p, size) - same as the corresponding realloc functions, but the old pointer is always freed, even if the realloc operation fails. The BSDs have reallocf()
  * added rpc command core.ppdefines - list preprocessor defines enabled in config
  * tcp - new flag F_CONN_NOSEND (mark connection for no-send data)
    * if flag set, the data is not sent over the connection
    * can be set by drop() inside event_route[tls:connection-out]
  * added rpc command core.module - list the names of loaded modules

==== kamailio.cfg ====

  * filter out sip scanner even when anti-flood is not enabled
  * handle retransmissions also for requests within dialogs

===== Tools =====

==== kamcmd ====

==== kamctl ====

  * added srv command
    * shortcuts to RPC commands to print sockets, aliases and available RPC commands
  * added db subcommand to mange records in version table

==== kamcli ====
