**Note: This document is work in progress and yet unfinished!**

This is a short installation howto for Debian Squeeze and Wheezy (stable and oldstable). 

This installation howto has been derived from here: http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/openimscore_on_ubuntu_howto.html

====== General preparations ======

We recommend, you install all components into a dedicated virtual machine. In our lab we use OpenVz-Containers, but you can also use any other virtual environment.

If you are not familiar with OpenVz or any other, please try [[http://www.proxmox.com/|Proxmox]] or similar.

===== Installation of the DNS-Server =====

**Important note:** A properly configured DNS-Server is mandatory for IMS, just adding according entries in your /etc/hosts/ will not be enough!

If you are running the DNS on your own machine then edit the file /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and uncomment this line:

  prepend domain_name_servers 127.0.0.1;

Copy the open-ims-DNS file to the bind folder and add these lines to /etc/bind/named.conf.local:

  zone "kamailio-ims.org" {
              type master;
              file "/etc/bind/kamailio-ims.org.dnszone";
  };
  
**You can find a very basic dnszone-file in "examples/ims_dnszone"-folder of the Kamailio repository**  
  
//You will need to restart bind for these changes to take effect.//

  /etc/init.d/bind9 restart
  
Check that this all works. Try a ping and see if you get a response:

  ping pcscf.kamailio-ims.org

====== Installation of the Kamailio-IMS-Packages ======

===== Configuration of the repository (All nodes) =====

First, install the Key for our repository:

  wget -O - http://repository.ng-voice.com/PublicKey | apt-key add -

Then add the repository to your "/etc/apt/sources.list":

  echo "deb http://repository.ng-voice.com squeeze ims rtpproxy" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

(replace squeeze with wheezy for Debian7).

And update the available packets:

 apt-get update

===== Installation of Proxy-/Interrogating-/Serving-CSCF Binary packages =====

Install the modules:

  apt-get install kamailio kamailio-ims-modules kamailio-presence-modules kamailio-sqlite-modules kamailio-tls-modules kamailio-xml-modules kamailio-xmlrpc-modules

If you want to have an RTP-Proxy/RTP-Relay, you find the "mediaproxy-ng" from sipwise in that repository as well,


  apt-get install ngcp-mediaproxy-ng
  
For I-CSCF you will also need a database structure:

mysql -uroot -p < icscf.sql
(on the database server)

===== Configuration of the network entities =====

You find the according configs in the examples folder of Kamailio (Trunk). For the Proxy-CSCF, use the configurations in examples/pcscf, for the Interrogating-CSCF in examples/icscf/, for the Serving-CSCF in examples/scscf/.

The configuration for each server consists of minimum two files:
  * kamailio.cfg - the main configuration-file (general for each entity)
  * pcscf.cfg / icscf.cfg / scscf.cfg - inidividual configurations for the P-/I-/S-CSCF (everything, that's individual per server)
  * pcscf.xml / icscf.xml / scscf.xml - Diameter configurations

Copy the required config files to your /etc/kamailio/-folder, adapt the config in the pcscf.cfg/pcscf.xml to your needs (change "ng-voice.com" and the IP to your domain/IP, please remember also the escaped versions of the domain and the IP, e.g. "pcscf\.ng-voice\.com). For components with Diameter-Interface (e.g. I-/S-CSCF) you will need to modify the according XML-files, e.g. "pcscf.xml").

Finally, you should edit the "/etc/default/kamailio"-File, in order to run the component.

Now the Component should be able to start:

  pcscf:/# /etc/init.d/kamailio start
  Starting kamailio: kamailioloading modules under /usr/lib/kamailio/modules:/usr/lib/kamailio/modules_s:/usr/lib/kamailio/modules_k
  Listening on
           udp: 109.239.50.67:5060
           tcp: 109.239.50.67:5060
  Aliases:
           tcp: pcscf:5060
           udp: pcscf:5060
           *: pcscf.ng-voice.com:5060
           *
And voila: Your component is running!
===== Installation of the FHoSS =====

Note: You will need to add the “non-free” packages to your repository:

  deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian lenny main non-free
  deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main non-free

Install the FHoSS from our repository:

  apt-get install openimscore-fhoss

Create the data in the database:

  mysql -uroot -p < /etc/fhoss/sql_files/hssdb.sql

Add some sample data, if you like:

  mysql -uroot -p < /etc/fhoss/sql_files/userdata.sql

The Webinterface should be reachable on port “8080″.

The following config files (/etc/fhoss) may be of interest:

  * DiameterPeerHSS.xml: The Diameter Interconnects and listening IP definition
  * hss.properties: The listening IP definition for the Web-Interface
  * hibernate.properties: The database interconnection for the HSS
  * conf/tomcat-users.xml: Usernames and Passwords for the Web-User (default Username is: “hssAdmin” and password “hss”)
  * Note: You will need to restart the FHoSS (“/etc/init.d/openimscore-fhoss restart”) in order to apply changes.
