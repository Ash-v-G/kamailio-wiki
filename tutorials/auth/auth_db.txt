This guide is designed to illustrate how to setup auth_db and usrloc to do digest authentication using a database backend. I will be using a postgresql database in this example. 

The following modules are required: usrloc, registrar, auth, auth_db


====== General preparations ======

You'll probably want to setup your database and add a few users. I will briefly go over how to setup the tables using the schema provided with kamailio.

====== Modules: auth, auth_db, usrloc ======

<code>
loadmodule "usrloc.so"
loadmodule "registrar.so"
loadmodule "auth.so"
loadmodule "auth_db.so"
</code>
