~~QNA~~

=?==== General =====

??? What is Kamailio?

!!! Kamailio is a SIP server, implementing the specifications from RFC3261. Its root functionality is routing any kind of SIP packets. On top of that, many conceptual features are implemented, see more at:
  * [[http://www.kamailio.org/w/features/|Kamailio Features]]

??? Is Kamailio a B2BUA?

!!! No, Kamailio is a flexible SIP proxy. Many people integrate Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, SEMS, or other products with Kamailio for a B2BUA. 
   * [[http://ftp.iptel.org/pub/sems/doc/current/ModuleDoc_sbc.html|SEMS B2BUA]]

??? Can Kamailio be used as SIP redirect server?

!!! Yes.

??? Can Kamailio be used as SIP registrar and location server?

!!! Yes.

??? Can Kamailio be used as SIP proxy server?

!!! Yes.

??? Can Kamailio be used as SIP load balancer server?

!!! Yes.

??? Can I load balance Asterisk or FreeSwitch with Kamailio?

!!! Yes.

??? Can Kamailio be used as SIP least cost routing server?

!!! Yes.


??? What transport layer protocols are implemented in Kamailio?

!!! At network layer, Kamailio supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

At transport layer, Kamailio support UDP, TCP, TLS and SCTP. Transmission can be done in asynchronous mode (configuration option), inclusive for TCP and TLS.

Kamailio can be used to bridge between any combinations of these protocols, e.g., receiving SIP packets on UDP over IPv4 and sending out on TLS over IPv6.

??? Is it possible to reload Kamailio configuration file?

!!! No, you must restart after you update the configuration file.

But note that many global parameters can be changed via RPC/MI commands without restart (e.g., TCP connecting timeout, debug level). Applying changes related to loaded modules or routing block require always a restart.

??? What is the license of Kamailio?

!!! Kamailio is an open source application licensed under GNU Public License version 2 (aka GPLv2). It can be used for free "as in beer".

Starting with end of 2008, contributions to core and several modules are done under BSD license. That means parts of it can be extracted and used under BSD license terms. But over all, when used as one application, the use must follow the terms of GPLv2, because GPLv2 is viral. 

??? Can it be installed on Windows?

!!! No. There is no official development pushed in this direction, Linux/Unix being the de facto for running servers. But it might not be big effort to make it compile using the Linux-like environments for Windows (such as cygwin).

=?==== Modules =====

??? What is a Kamailio module?

!!! A module is an extension that compiles in a separate object file and can be loaded at Kamailio startup. Usually a module exports new functions that can be used in configuration file routing blocks.

??? Where are Kamailio modules located?

!!! Inside the source tree, there are three directories:
  * modules/
  * modules_k/
  * modules_s/

Each module is located in its own sub-folder. The documentation for modules that are bundled in Kamailio packages is available at:
  * http://kamailio.org/docs/modules/stable/

??? Which modules are compiled by default?

!!! The modules that have the same dependencies as the core of Kamailio. Those that are not compiled by default are kept in the variable 'exclude_modules' of Makefile.

??? How can I compile and install a module that is excluded by default?

!!! Add it to the variable 'include_modules' to the command 'make cfg'. For example, compiling and installing the modules app_lua and db_mysql:

<code>
make FLAVOUR=kamailio include_modules="app_lua db_mysql" cfg
make all
make install
</code>
=?==== Media Streams =====

??? Does Kamailio relay media streams?

!!! No, //however// Kamailio can be configured to proxy media if needed. 
  * [[http://www.kamailio.org/docs/modules/stable/|See rtpproxy, iprtpproxy, and mediaproxy]]

??? What codecs are supported by Kamailio?

!!! **Kamailio supports all codecs** (//even codecs that haven't been created yet//).

Since Kamailio is a SIP proxy, it does not handle the media streams. Codecs are negotiated between the two endpoints.

??? Can Kamailio be used for video calls?

!!! Yes, Kamailio can be used for video calls. The two SIP phones must support video codecs/calling.

=?==== Getting Started =====

??? What are the minimum knowledge requirements before starting with Kamailio?

!!! To be familiar with Linux and understand Session Initiation Protocol (SIP - RFC3261).

??? Any step-by-step guide to install Kamailio?

!!! Yes, see:
  * http://www.kamailio.org/wiki/#installation

=?==== DNS =====

??? Does it have support for ENUM?

!!! Yes. See enum module.

??? What kind of DNS queries can it do?

!!! Kamailio can do next DNS query types: A-Name, C-Name, AAAA (IPv6), SRV, NAPTR and TXT.

??? Can it do DNS-based (SRV) load balancing?

!!! Yes.

=?==== Instant Messaging and Presence =====

??? Can it route SIP instant messaging requests (page mode, RFC3428)?

!!! Yes. There is nothing special to do for that in configuration file, MESSAGE requests are simply routed as any other SIP request.

??? Can it store instant messages for offline users and deliver them when the users become online?

!!! Yes. See msilo module.

??? Can it route instant messages using MSRP (RFC4975)?

!!! Yes. Kamailio offers an embedded MSRP relay function via msrp module. You don't need any external application for relaying MSRP packets.

??? Can it handle end-to-end presence requests?

!!! Yes. There is nothing special to do for that in configuration file, SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests are simply routed as any other SIP request.

??? Does it have support for SIP SIMPLE Presence (presence agent model)?

!!! Yes. You have to use presence and presence_xml modules to handle PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE requests.

??? Does it have support for Resource Lists Service?

!!! Yes. You have to use rls module.

??? Can it act as a presence user agent?

!!! Yes. See pua module and its extensions named with 'pua_' prefix (such as pua_usrloc, pua_dialoginfo, etc.).

??? Can it handle subscription requests for dialog states (aka, blinking lamps)?

!!! Yes. You have to use dialog module together with presence_dialoginfo and pua_dialoginfo modules.

??? Does it have support for handling XCAP?

!!! Yes. Kamailio offers an embedded XCAP server via xcap_server module. It can receive and handle directly the XCAP requests without using any external application.

The xcap_client module can be used when you want to interact with an external XCAP server (that could be another instance of Kamailio).

=?==== NAT Traversal =====

??? Can Kamailio be used with phones connecting from behind NAT?

Yes, Kamailio supports the so called "far-end NAT traversal". One solution is to use nathelper for NAT traversal of SIP signaling, and rtpproxy modules with the rtpproxy (http://rtpproxy.org) application for relaying RTP packets.

??? Can Kamailio be installed behind NAT (e.g., like on Amazon EC2)?

Yes. You have to set the public IP address as advertised attribute to listen parameter:

  listen=_localsocket_ advertise _publicaddr_

Example:

  listen=udp:10.10.10.10:5060 advertise 11.11.11.11:5060
