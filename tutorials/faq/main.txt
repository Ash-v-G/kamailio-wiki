??? What transport layer protocols are implemented in Kamailio?

!!! At network layer, Kamailio supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

At transport layer, Kamailio support UDP, TCP, TLS and SCTP. Transmission can be done in asynchronous mode (configuration option), inclusive for TCP and TLS.

Kamailio can be used to bridge between any combinations of these protocols, e.g., receiving SIP packets on UDP over IPv4 and sending out on TLS over IPv6.
=?==== Media Streams =====

??? Does Kamailio relay media streams?

!!! No, //however// Kamailio can be configured to proxy media if needed. 
  * [[http://www.kamailio.org/docs/modules/stable/|See rtpproxy, iprtpproxy, and mediaproxy]]

??? What codecs are supported by Kamailio?

!!! **Kamailio supports all codecs** (//even codecs that haven't been created yet//).

Since Kamailio is a SIP proxy, it does not handle the media streams. Codecs are negotiated between the two endpoints.

??? Can Kamailio be used for video calls?

!!! Yes, Kamailio can be used for video calls. The two SIP phones must support video codecs/calling.
