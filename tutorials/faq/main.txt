=?==== Media Streams =====

??? Does Kamailio relay media streams?

!!! No, //however// Kamailio can be configured to proxy media if needed. (See rtpproxy, iprtpproxy, and mediaproxy http://www.kamailio.org/w/features/)

??? What codecs are supported by Kamailio?

!!! **Kamailio supports all codecs** (//even codecs that haven't been created yet//).

Since Kamailio is a SIP proxy, it does not handle the media streams. Codecs are negotiated between the two endpoints.

??? Can Kamailio be used for video calls?

!!! Yes, Kamailio can be used for video calls. The two SIP phones must support video codecs/calling.
