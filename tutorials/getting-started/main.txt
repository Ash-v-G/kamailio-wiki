====== Kamailio - Getting Started Guide ======

A collection of guidelines and useful links to smoothen the understanding and
deploying of Kamailio for newbies.

Feel free to add new content here.

The first version of the tutorial was written for Kamailio v4.3.x.

===== Prerequisites =====

==== SIP ====

The initial name of the project was SIP Express Router (aka SER) and that says
it all: Kamailio is a SIP router at the core. It means that it works at the
lower layer of SIP packets, routing each and every SIP message that it
receives based on the policies specified in the configuration file.

It is important to understand that it is not a telephony engine at its core, a
VoIP call is seen as a sequence of SIP messages sharing the same attributes
for caller, callee and signaling tokens such as Call-ID, From tag and To tag.

Given the above, a good understanding of SIP is critical to get faster
familiar with Kamailio, especially with its configuration file routing
rules.

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is specified by IETF (www.ietf.org), with
the core specification in the RFC 3261:

  * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261

Many other RFCs add to the core specifications, look at what is published by
the IETF Working Groups for SIP and SIMPLE.

IETF RFC documents are a bit dry to read, with particular language suitable
for technical specifications, therefore trying to learn SIP directly from RFCs
could be not that easy. Fortunately there are plenty of free online resources,
tutorials or blogs, as well as books, that can help understanding SIP faster.

A SIP Introduction tutorial was written by SER/Kamailio developers quite some
time ago. It is available inside source tree of Kamailio, in the folder
doc/sip/. It is docbook xml format, the html version can be read online at:

==== Logical Programming ====

Kamailio configuration file is not just a set of 'parameter=value' line. It
has active components for runtime, named routing blocks. A routing block is a
group of actions that specify what should be done for each SIP message.

The actions are exported by Kamailio core or modules and are like functions
exported by a library. Those actions can be combined in conditional statements
like IF and SWITCH or in loops like WHILE. Modularity is provided by the
ability to execute a routing block from another routing block.

Therefore, understanding logical programming is important as well. Be sure you
are familiar with concepts such as functions, variables, conditions or loops.

IF, SWITCH and WHILE are pretty similar to other imperative languages such as
C, Perl, Python or Java. Even Shell/Bash programming is useful to get into
Kamailio configuration structure.

==== Linux/Unix ====

Being developed for Unix/Linux, managing a Kamailio instance, from
installation to runtime and maintenance involves operations specific for Linux
administration, like running command line applications from terminal,
configure network and firewall to allow sending/receiving SIP and RTP packets,
a.s.o.

Troubleshooting Kamailio and SIP requires knowledge of various tools for
reading and searching log files (e.g., grep, awk), sniffing the network (e.g.,
ngrep, tcpdump, wireshark). Of course, knowing to work with text editor,
especially the ones for terminal if the server is remote, is quite obvious
(e.g., vim, joe, nano, pico, emacs, etc.).

===== Initial Installation =====

==== From Sources ====

Install current stable version:

  * [[install:4.3.x:git|Install Kamailio v4.3.x From GIT]]

Install development version (master branch):

  * [[install:devel:git|Install Kamailio Devel Version From GIT]]
==== Debian ====

Kamailio is part of latest official stable Debian distribution (and its Ubuntu cousin), but might be an older version.

To use most recent Kamailio release, you can use the APT repositories hosted by Kamailio project, see details at:

  * [[packages:debs|KAMAILIO DEBS: Debian - Ubuntu]]

Then, the typical way of installing packages can be used:

<code>
apt-get update
apt-get install kamailio
</code>

Various modules are packaged separately, you can search the repository to see what is available:

<code>
apt-cache search kamailio
</code>

Install the other packages of the modules you may need, like mysql or tls modules -- they can be installed with:

<code>
apt-get install kamailio-mysql-modules kamailio-tls-modules
</code>
==== CentoOS ====

===== Configuration File =====

==== Overview ====

==== Default Configuration File ====

===== Tools =====

==== kamctl ====

Kamctl is part of Kamailio project (in the same source tree) and installed by default.

It has a configuration file named **kamctlrc**, located in the same folder with **kamailio.cfg**. You have to edit it to set your SIP domain, the database engine, username/password/... to connect to database, etc.

This is the tool to manage kamailio from command line, providing lots of operations, such as adding/removing/updating SIP users, controlling the ACL for users, managing the records for LCR or load balancing, viewing registered users and internal statistics, etc.

When needed to interact with Kamailio, it does it via FIFO file created by **mi_fifo** module. Operations to the database are done by connecting directly to the database server.

==== kamdbctl ====

Kamctl is part of Kamailio project (in the same source tree) and installed by default.

It uses the same configuration file like **kamctl**, respectively the **kamctlrc**.

The tool can be used to create and manage the database structure needed by Kamailio, therefore it should be immediately after Kamailio installation, in case you plan to run Kamailio with a database backend.

It is not used for managing the records inside the database tables, just for database structure and access to the database (e.g., granting/revoking access to database server). For managing the records inside database table, **kamctl** is the tool.

==== kamcmd ====

Kamctl is part of Kamailio project (in the same source tree) and installed by default.

This is an application that can send RPC commands to Kamailio from command line. It requires that the **ctl** module is loaded by Kamailio.

==== siremis ====

It is a web management interface for Kamailio, written in PHP -- more at:

  * http://www.siremis.org

==== kamcli ====

It is a command line application write in Python, more or less an alternative to **kamctl**. It has a modular architecture, allowing to extend it by writing new plugins.

  * https://github.com/asipto/kamcli

===== Typical Use Cases =====

==== NAT Traversal ====

The default **kamailio.cfg** comes with NAT traversal support, relying on RTPProxy for RTP relaying. The NAT traversal support has to be enabled by defining WITH_NAT:

<code c>
#!define WITH_NAT
</code>

==== VoIP Provider ====

The default **kamailio.cfg** is practically an implementation of simple SIP operator services:

  * user authentication
  * IP authorization
  * accounting
  * registrar and location services
  * attacks detection and blocking (anti-flood protection)
  * NAT travesal
  * short dialing on server
  * multiple identities (aliases) for subscribers
  * multi-domain support
  * routing to a PSTN gateway
  * routing to a voicemail server
  * TLS encryption
  * instant messaging (pager mode with MESSAGE requests)
  * presence services

Not all the above features are enabled by default -- read the comments at the top of **kamailio.cfg** in order to find what tokens must be defined.

==== Load Balancing ====
