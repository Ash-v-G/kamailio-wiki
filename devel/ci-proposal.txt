==== Continuous Integration on Kamailio Project ====

=== Automated Debian/Ubuntu package building ===

The build system for Debian and Ubuntu packages service is kindly sponsored by [[http://www.sipwise.com|Sipwise]]. Sipwise is providing the hosting and man power to create and manage this system.

[[http://deb.kamailio.org|deb.kamailio.org]] is based on [[https://github.com/mika/jenkins-debian-glue|jenkins-debian-glue]] project running on AWS EC2 environment thanks to [[http://michael-prokop.at/|Michael Prokop]] and myself. All the needed files, scripts and info to reproduce this system is kept public at [[https://github.com/sipwise/kamailio-deb-jenkins|github]].
