====== Kamailio v5.0 Design ======

===== Overview =====

After 15 years of development, it is time for Kamailio v5.0.

This page collects suggestions and ideas for major refactoring of various components to make the leap to v5.0.

===== Initial Remarks =====

Initial content for this document is listing also ideas popped up during discussions at Fosdem 2016 and Kamailio Development Workshop - among participants: Camille Oudout, Daniel-Constantin Mierla, Federico Cabiddu, Giacomo Vacca, Henning Westerholt, Olle E. Johansson, Torrey Searle, Victor Seva.

===== Configuration File =====

Goals:

  * have at least one option of an optimized configuration file interpreter targeting high performance SIP routing deployments
  * have at least one option of a more flexible configuration language that allows:
    * extended language syntax
    * reloading routing rules at runtime

To achieve the above, following sub-sections collects the proposals for configuration file language.


==== Exporting Functions To Embedded Interpreters ====

  * define and implement an export interface from modules to embedded interpreters to automatically add new functions to embedded interpreters, in a similar fashion as for adding functions to configuration file

==== Routing Logic In Embedded Interpreters Scripting ====

  * writing the routing logic only in a scripting language supported via embedded interpreters
  * eventually setting core parameters, loading modules and setting modules' parameters are still done using the kamailio configuration file but all routing blocks should be possible to be written in an embedded language
  * routing logic in an embedded language should allow reloading at runtime without kamailio restart

===== Source Tree Structure =====

Goals:

  * group files per components to be easier to spot their role, especially the core, include files and utilities

==== Reorganizing Source Files Location ====

It was discussed in the past:

  * source code files should be relocated to have a better structure for include headers, core files, modules and internal libraries as well as utilities

Two models proposed:

  * a) only move core files in a new 'core' folder in the root directory
  * b) move all source code files for Kamailio in a new 'src' folder, with further re-organization with subfolders inside 'src'

===== Build System =====

Revising the build system based on Makefiles.

Alternatives to analyze:

  * configure
  * cmake

===== Continuous Integration =====

Goals:

  * attempt to make a more consistent and "easy to contribute to" continuous integration eco-system 


==== Unit Test Framework ====

Reviving the exiting unit testing or selecting another framework.

==== Minimal Unit Tests ====

Defining a minimum set of automatic tests that needs to be provided by each module:

  * a minimal config for loading the module, to be sure it doesn't have missing linking symbols
  * can be done with a config as simple as:

<code>

loadmodule "foo.so"

request_route {
  ;
}
</code>

  * or can require setting some module parameters or even loading other modules
